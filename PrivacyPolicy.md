# Privacy Policy for InboxGenie

**1. Data We Process**
InboxGenie processes your Gmail emails only when you explicitly enable the extension. We extract:
- **Event details** (dates, times, locations, titles) from emails.
- No sensitive data (e.g., email bodies, attachments, or sender/recipient info) is accessed unless required for event parsing.

**2. How We Use Your Data**
- **Local Processing**: All data is processed locally in your browser.
- **Third-Party AI Services**: If you configure an AI service (e.g., OpenAI), event-related text is sent securely to that service only for parsing. We do not control third-party data practices—review their policies before use.
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Extracted events are added to your calendar via Google’s API. We never access other calendar data.

**3. Data Storage & Sharing**  
- **Browser Storage**: InboxGenie temporarily stores extracted event data (dates, times, titles) in Chrome’s local storage **only on your device** to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls.  
- **Automatic Deletion**: Stored data is cleared when you uninstall the extension or manually reset it via settings.  
- **No External Sharing**: We never sell, upload, or share your stored data with third parties.  

**4. Security** 
- **Encryption**: All communication with third-party services (e.g., OpenAI) uses HTTPS/TLS.
- **Permissions**: Requires only the minimum Google OAuth scopes (gmail.readonly and calendar.events).

**5. Your Rights** 
- **Delete Data**: Uninstall the extension to revoke access to your Gmail/Calendar.
- **Access Controls**: Configure or disable InboxGenie anytime via Chrome extensions settings.

**6. Contact Us** 
- For questions or data requests, email:  happyiscreating@gmail.com
